### Open research into data vis design process

This repository archives survey responses and resources gathered during my research on data visualization design processes.

### Documents

- `Data Vis Process Survey Results.csv` is an excerpt of results collected so far from [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12kr9SpYCHg0YYIJJJDj0t8V8Tt79cVhB-voX1rv9RMs/viewform).  Respondents who indicated they did not want their responses shared have been stripped from this version.
- `Data Vis Process Reading List.pdf` is what it sounds like: a collection of publications that address design process generally and data vis process specifically. Enjoy!
